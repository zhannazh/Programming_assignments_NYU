Overall, income per capita does not seem to have changed much over such a short period of time. 

Oceania: The upper whisker in the boxplot for Oceania keeps jumping up and down over time. 
This could be due to changes in countries with non-missing income values. The individual histogram
shows an uneven (almost bimodal) distribution of per capita income towards 2012.

Europe: Median per capita income seems to have declined in Europe between 2007-2012 but overall
we observe little change (boxplot). According to individual histograms, per capita income in European 
countries with outlier (large) incomes declined.

Africa:  The upper whisker and outliers are moving up slightly between 2010 and 2012, but the median
income per capita seems to have dropped between 2011 and 2012. This is consistent with the trend
exhibited in individual histograms, where it seems that more countries bunch at lower income 
towards the end of the time period. 

Asia: The median seems to increase slightly. The upper whisker and 3rd quartile go up, then down,
and then up again. In the histogram, it is clear that some outlier observations keep moving to
the right (i.e., per capita income is getting higher in countries that already 
had high per capita income).

North America: Median per capita income does not seem to have changed much, but the distance
from the median to either quartile (1st and 3rd) seems to have evened out with time (primarily because
the 3rd quartile and the upper wishker dropped).

South America: Overall, a slight improvement in income per capita.
